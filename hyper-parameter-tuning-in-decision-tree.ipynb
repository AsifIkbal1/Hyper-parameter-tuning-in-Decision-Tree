So that, tree get splited to N number of nodes and N number of depth. This leads to ***overfitting***. In other words, ***low bias and high variance***. Before going forward for hyper parameter tuning, familiarity of these terms is crucial. Let's get breif understanding.\n***\n* **Bias** - Performance of ML model on Training dataset (Known dataset). If models performs better on training data then bias of the model is `low`; otherwise, `High`\n* **Variance** - Performance of ML model on Test dataset (Unknown dataset). If model performs better on test data then variance of the model is `low`; otherwise, `High`\n\nIn ideal condition, we need `low bias and low variance`. That means, model should perform well on both training(known) data and testing(unkown) data \n\n**Overfitting** - It is a situation when model gets trained so well on training set; that it over-learns patterns in training data and it can not generalize well on new(unkown) data. Hence, it does not perform better on testing data. In other words, overfitting is a situation of `low bias and high variance`.\n\nIn practical, overfitting can be identified by checking ***Train Accuracy and Test Accuracy***. If difference between training accuracy and testing accuracy is high, it indicates model is overfitting and will not perform well on unknown data. So, we will try to minimize this difference to overcome from overfitting and to make model perform well on unkown data.\n\n> **By default, due to the nature of decision tree, it splits to N number of nodes and N number of depth which cause overfitting. That's why, Hyper-parameter tuning is necessary.

If set to 2, then Tree will be splitted to depth 2 (level 0,1 and 2). If set to None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure. Restricting depth of the tree will stop Decision Tree to make over splits and over-learn training data which will handle overfitting.\n\n* `max_samples_leaf` = We can specify minimum samples required to split node and create leaf nodes from it. For example, if it is set to 20, then splitting current node should have more than 20 samples in its child nodes. If not, then tree will not do split from that current node. This can again restrict size of the Tree and can help to handle overfitting.\n\n* `ccp_alpha` = ccp stands for Cost Complexity Pruning. Pruning is a process of cutting weak nodes(nodes where we have less confidence) from the tree. ccp_alpha is a powerful hyperparameter and setting it appropiately can improve model performance significantly. \n\n**High value of ccp_alpha shows high amount of pruning and low values of ccp_alpha shows less amount of pruning.**\n\n* `criterion` = This hyperparameter is also crucial and it does not help to handle overfitting. But, it helps to select order of features to split nodes on. Basically, we can calculate from several features which feature is best to split the current node on. This is important because we want to create a tree with smallest possible depth which is accurate as well as efficient due to small depth.\n\nThree values that can be specified in criterion are: <code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">1) Gini 2) Entropy 3) log_loss</code>\n\n*By default, `Gini impurity` is set in criterion hyperparameter because gini impurity is efficient than `Entropy`.

Compared to other algorithms decision trees requires less effort for data preparation during pre-processing.\n2. A decision tree does not require normalization of data.\n3. A decision tree does not require scaling of data as well.\n4. Missing values in the data also do NOT affect the process of building a decision tree to any considerable extent.\n5. A Decision tree model is very intuitive and easy to explain to technical teams as well as stakeholders.\n6. One Deicison tree model is train, time to give predictions on new data is very less.\n\n### Disadvantage:\n1. A small change in the data can cause a large change in the structure of the decision tree causing instability.\n2. For a Decision tree sometimes calculation can go far more complex compared to other algorithms.\n4. Decision tree often involves higher time to train the model.\n5. Decision tree training is relatively expensive as the complexity and time has taken are more.\n6. The Decision Tree algorithm is inadequate for applying regression and predicting continuous values.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n**I Hope you found this notebook userful and enjoyable.**\n\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">😊Also, mention or discuss in comment section any other hyper-parameter of Decision Tree Classifier which is important but I haven't explained in this notebook.</span>\n\n**Thank you**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style='color:black'>\n<b>Tip:</b> I would strongly recommend to go through the videos and article mentioned in the reference below to understand theory behind Decision Tree and some of the terms mentioned in this notebook like entropy and gini impurity; doing so will help to understand steps taken in this notebook more.\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Reference:***\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L39rN6gz7Y\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IQOtJ4NI_0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aIFgrrTqOw\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_cost_complexity_pruning.html\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html\n\nhttps://dhirajkumarblog.medium.com/top-5-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-decision-tree-algorithm-428ebd199d9a","metadata":{}}]}
